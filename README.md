## Executive Summary

This repository contains code for conducting the simulation study in Chase and Boonstra (2018). 

## Further details

In more detail, there are three <samp>R</samp> scripts (ending in  <samp>.R</samp>) included in this repository (in addition to this README). 

<samp>functions.R</samp> provides all of the necessary functions to fit the (i) multistep elastic net, (ii) the IPF Lasso (i.e. a multistep elastic net with $lambda = 1$), and (iii) the (sparse) group lasso. 

<samp>run_sims.R</samp> conducts a simulation of a given scenario 

<samp>eval_sims.R</samp> gives the code to create the figures and tables in the manuscript and supplementary material reporting on the simulation study.
